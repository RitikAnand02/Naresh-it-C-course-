1)Convert Centimeter to Inches

Write a program that takes input from the user, take some input for centimeter and convert that into inches .

input :- 1

output:-0.3937

input :- 20

output:-7.87
ans:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float cm, inches;
    printf("centimeters:");
    scanf("%f", &cm);
    inches = cm/2.54;
    printf("%f", inches);
}

3)Area of Different Shape

Write a C program that takes 2 number as input and store that number in a variable, First input for radius of a Circle and 2nd input for side of a Square.

Enter radius of Circle : 12

Enter side of Square : 5

Area of Circle is : 452.16

Area of Square is : 25
ans:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float r, a, A, B;
    printf("Radius:");
    scanf("%f", &r);
    printf("side of square:");
    scanf("%f", &a);
    A = 3.14 * r * r;
    B = a * a;
    printf("%f\n,%f", A, B);
}

4)ASCII Sum

Write a C program to take two character input from the user and print the ASCII value of that two character and display its sum.

Enter a character: a b

ASCII value of a is : 97

ASCII value of b is : 98

ASCII sum of a & b is : 195
ans:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
    char c1, c2;
    printf("Enter the first character:");
    scanf("%c", &c1);
    printf("Enter the second character:");
    scanf(" %c", &c2);
    printf("%c ASCII value is %d", c1, c1);

    printf("\n%c ASCII value is %d", c2, c2);

    printf("\nSum of %c & %c is %d\n", c1, c2, c1 + c2);
}

5)Convert days in Y-M-D

Write a program in C to input number of days. Find and display number of years, weeks, months and days.

Input as : 390

Output as : 1 Year, 3 Weeks, 0 Month, 4 Days
ans:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n = 390, a, b, c, d;
    a = n / 365;
    n = n % 365;

    b = n / 30;
    n = n % 30;
    c = n % 7;
    d = n / 7;
    n = n % 7;
    printf("year:%d,weeks:%d,months:%d,days:%d", a, d, b, c);
}
