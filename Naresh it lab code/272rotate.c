/*
Que 8 : Write a C program to rotate an array of integers to the right by a specified number of positions.
------  For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and you want to rotate it to the right by 2 positions,
        the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].(Develop it by using pointers & function).

-> create int main() function.
-> create void rotateRight(int *arr, int size, int positions) function.
-> in main function print the output of array before and after rotation.

Sample input :
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the number of positions to rotate to the right: 2

Sample output :
Before rotation : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
After rotation : 4, 5, 1, 2, 3
